# Tensigh External Memory Export Format (`tensigh-memories-export.json`)

This document describes the JSON format generated by the "Export Memories (External)" button in the Tensigh Pro Chrome extension. This format is intended for use by other applications, such as a desktop version.

## Root Structure

The exported file contains a single JSON array at the root level. Each element in the array represents one memory (flashcard).

```json
[
  { ... memory object 1 ... },
  { ... memory object 2 ... },
  ...
]
```

## Memory Object Structure

Each memory object within the root array has the following key-value pairs:

```json
{
  "front": "string",          // The content displayed on the front of the card. Defaults to "" if missing.
  "back": "string",           // The content displayed on the back of the card. Defaults to "" if missing.
  "tags": ["string", ...], // An array of strings representing user-defined tags. Defaults to [] if missing.
  "sourceUrl": "string|null", // The URL of the webpage where the memory was created. Defaults to null if missing.
  "sourceTitle": "string|null",// The title of the webpage where the memory was created. Defaults to null if missing.
  "createdAt": "string|null"   // An ISO 8601 formatted timestamp string (e.g., "2023-10-27T12:00:00.000Z") 
                               // indicating when the memory was created in the extension. Defaults to null if missing.
}
```

**Key Details:**

*   **`front` (String):** The primary question or term.
*   **`back` (String):** The answer or definition. This often includes the text content of the paragraph where the memory was created.
*   **`tags` (Array of Strings):** User-assigned tags for organization.
*   **`sourceUrl` (String | Null):** The web address from which the memory originated.
*   **`sourceTitle` (String | Null):** The title of the source web page.
*   **`createdAt` (String | Null):** The date and time the memory was saved in the extension, in ISO 8601 format.

**Excluded Fields:**

This external format intentionally excludes internal data used by the extension for spaced repetition and management, such as:

*   Internal `id`
*   `nextReview` date
*   `easeFactor`
*   `interval`
*   `reviewCount`
*   `lastReviewed` date
*   Internal `status`
*   Detailed HTML context (`paragraphHtml`)

This simplified structure makes it easier for external applications to parse and utilize the core flashcard content.
